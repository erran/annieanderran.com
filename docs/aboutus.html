            <p>Our love story began back in 2016 when Erran sent a super-like to Annie on Tinder while putting his Tinder Plus subscription to good use.</p>

<p>The two matched shortly after but it was a while before they actually chatted. However, once they started, they were in non-stop and ever so slightly obsessive communication with each other.</p>

<p>While on a night out with her friend Shannon (now a bridesmaid) some weeks later, Annie had mentioned, <i>again</i>, this guy she was chatting to and going on about how nice he was. So Shannon messaged Erran off Annie’s phone asking him if he would like to come down and join them in Ollies Nightclub in Belfast.</p> 

<p>They were both shocked when he replied YES and said he would be there in 15 minutes. PANIC! The butterflies were real and there were lots of smiles, hugs and giggles when the couple met for the first time in person and they danced the night away and went on to be inseparable since that evening. After some flirtatious banter and discovering a real mutual love of travel, design, technology and partying in late-night bars… the rest is history!</p>

<p>Many memories and moons later, A&E have travelled to Spain, France, America, the Netherlands and Ireland. Have moved in together and had the greatest little surprise to ever happen to them, Kai. A few months ago, Erran finally popped the question during his parents’ house-warming party in front of their friends and family, and Annie said yes. Now they can’t wait for this exciting new chapter in their lives to begin!</p>
